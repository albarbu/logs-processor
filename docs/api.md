## Logs count API endpoint

Access the `/docs` path on the local domain and use the Swagger interface to test the implemented API endpoint.

*Observation*: When no filters are set, probably it will be indicated to have the `startDate` and `endDate` set by default in such a way so the count is executed only for the last month (for safety reasons since the count can be time consuming on larger periods of time).
